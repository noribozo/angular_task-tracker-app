# TaskTracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3.
It is based on Brad Traversy's video tutorial. If it does not work well is beacuse the backend used (json-server) is not for deployment but you can take a look at the code. Locally it works fine.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `npm run server` for the backend. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`
